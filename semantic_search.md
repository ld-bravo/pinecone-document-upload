## Key differences between the two approaches:

### LangChain Approach:

1. Uses LangChain's high-level abstractions
2. Simplified embedding and vector store interaction
3. Easier to integrate with other LangChain components
4. More pythonic and readable

### Native Libraries Approach:

1. Uses direct Pinecone and OpenAI API calls
2. More control over the embedding and querying process
3. Slightly more verbose
4. Gives more flexibility for customization

### Similarities:

Both methods generate embeddings
Both perform similarity search in Pinecone
Both use OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate responses based on context
Both return a structured result with query, similar documents, and generated response

### Prerequisites:

Populated Pinecone index with embedded documents
Configured .env file with API keys
Install required libraries

  ```
  pip install python-dotenv pinecone-client openai langchain-openai langchain-community
  ```
